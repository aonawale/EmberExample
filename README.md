# Ember-example

This is a Example App to do an integration with an example API:

`http://ec2-54-172-57-71.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000/api/hotels/17219/rooms/2`

The `hotels/{hotel_id}/rooms/{room_id}` is the schema. CORS is enabled on server.

## The Test

Fork this project, configure the adapter os application, setup the model and routes to do a `GET`on our API.

After that,  commit in a public repository. Send the link to us.

Good lucky!
